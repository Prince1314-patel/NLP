WHAT IS NLP?
    Certainly! **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is an interdisciplinary field that bridges computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. Its primary goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. Here are the key points:

    1. **Data Processing**: NLP focuses on processing data encoded in natural language. This includes text corpora collected from various sources.

    2. **Approaches**: NLP employs different approaches:
    - **Rule-based**: Using predefined rules to analyze and generate language.
    - **Statistical**: Leveraging statistical models to learn patterns from data.
    - **Neural-based**: Utilizing deep learning techniques for complex language tasks.

    3. **Major Tasks**:
    - **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.
    - **Text Classification**: Assigning labels or categories to text (e.g., spam detection).
    - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Extracting meaning from text (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition).
    - **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Creating human-like text (e.g., chatbots, summarization).

    4. **History**:
    - In the 1940s, Alan Turing proposed the Turing test, which involved automated interpretation of natural language.
    - Symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s) used rule-based systems.
    - Notable systems include SHRDLU (restricted vocabularies) and ELIZA (psychotherapist simulation).
    - Ross Quillian demonstrated language understanding with a small vocabulary.
    - The field evolved over time, incorporating statistical and neural approaches¹.

APPROACHES USED TO IMPLEMENT NLP
    Certainly! There are several approaches used to implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks:

    1. **Heuristics-Based NLP**:
    - This initial approach relies on predefined rules based on domain knowledge and expertise.
    - Example: Regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching².

    2. **Statistical Machine Learning-Based NLP**:
    - It leverages statistical rules and machine learning algorithms.
    - These models learn from data and adapt to language patterns.
    - Widely used for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.

    3. **Neural Network-Based NLP (Deep Learning)**:
    - The latest approach involves neural networks, particularly deep learning.
    - Neural networks learn hierarchical representations from raw text data.
    - Used for tasks like machine translation, named entity recognition, and text generation³.

CHALLENGES IN NLP
    Ambiguity(same sentence having different meaning)
        I saw the boy on the beach with my binoculars.
        I have never tasted a cake quite like that one before!
    Contextual Words(same word used in a sentence can have diffrent meaning)
        I ran to the store because we ran out of milk.
    Colloquialisms and slang(sentence that have diffrent meaning from their original meaning)
        Piece of cake, pulling your leg
    Irony,sarcasm and tonal diffrence(sentence may have diffrent meaning according to situation)
