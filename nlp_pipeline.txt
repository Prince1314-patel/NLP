NLP PIPELINE

    The Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline refers to the sequence of processes involved in analyzing and understanding human language. It's a crucial framework for transforming raw text data into meaningful insights. Here are the typical steps in an NLP pipeline:

    1. **Data Acquisition**:
        - Collect relevant text data from various sources, such as websites, emails, social media, or PDFs.
        - Techniques include using public datasets, web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup, converting images to text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and extracting text from PDFs.
        - Data augmentation methods (e.g., synonym replacement, back translation) can enhance existing data.

    2. **Text Cleaning**:
        - Clean acquired data by handling HTML tags, spelling mistakes, and special characters.
        - Techniques include Unicode normalization and removing unwanted elements.

    3. **Text Preprocessing**:
        - Tokenization: Split text into individual words or subunits (tokens).
        - Stop word removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., "the," "and") that don't carry significant meaning.
        - Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").
        - Part-of-speech tagging: Label words with their grammatical roles (e.g., noun, verb).

    4. **Feature Engineering**:
        - Create relevant features from text data (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF vectors).
        - Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) represent words as dense vectors.
        - Extract linguistic features (e.g., sentiment scores, named entities).

    5. **Model Building**:
        - Train machine learning models (e.g., classifiers, neural networks) on labeled data.
        - Common NLP tasks include text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.

    6. **Evaluation**:
        - Assess model performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
        - Fine-tune hyperparameters and iterate as needed.

    7. **Deployment**:
        - Deploy the trained model for real-world applications (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).
